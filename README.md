## Rube Goldberg Machine
Made by Timothy, Ronit, Jay

A large Rube Goldberg machine that uses traditional and theoretical mechanisms and their physics to reach a festive goal. Made using HTML5 canvas, Matter.js, P5, and of course JavaScript.

The commit "history" is not ideal, be forewarned. We were the only people in our class who used git, and we were very bad at it. I think we've all gotten much better since them, but for the purpose of history, the commit history shall be preserved.
